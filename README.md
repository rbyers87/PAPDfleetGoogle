setup to backup and save to google drive.

app would give 404 when refresh on anything other than start page.  Claude.ai instructions:

Claude.ai fixed working github pages with solution 1

Solution 1: Use HashRouter (Easiest)
Replace BrowserRouter with HashRouter in your main routing setup. This uses hash-based routing which works well with GitHub Pages:
typescript// In your main App.tsx or router setup
import { HashRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/other-page" element={<OtherPage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

next step to get work orders to download as pdf from claude.ai need to install dependecies:
Step 1: Install the missing TypeScript types
First, add the TypeScript types for pdfMake:
npm install --save-dev @types/pdfmake

remove take home box from "all status" because it doesn't do anything.

need to build selection choices for repairs

need to add ability to make work order without putting out of service.

take away free form box and make it selection for unit location


if github page not refreshing, delete the gh-page branch and redeploy with terminal npm run deploy

Clean your build cache:

# Remove the dist folder and rebuild
rm -rf dist
npm run build

Removed pre-deploy and deploy from package.json file and added deploy.yml.  leaving them in package.json required each deploy to happen locally in terminal and now it will auto deploy with github actions.  This keeps it consistent with the backup.yml file.

latest chatgpt instructions:

5. Deploy

Push your code to main.

GitHub Actions will automatically run the deploy.yml workflow.

After it finishes, your site will be live at:

https://rbyers87.github.io/PAPDfleetGoogle/


✅ From now on, you don’t run npm run deploy manually.
Just git push, and GitHub builds + deploys the site automatically with your Supabase env vars.
