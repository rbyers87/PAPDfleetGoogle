setup to backup and save to google drive.

app would give 404 when refresh on anything other than start page.  Claude.ai instructions:

Claude.ai fixed working github pages with solution 1

Solution 1: Use HashRouter (Easiest)
Replace BrowserRouter with HashRouter in your main routing setup. This uses hash-based routing which works well with GitHub Pages:
typescript// In your main App.tsx or router setup
import { HashRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/other-page" element={<OtherPage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

next step to get work orders to download as pdf from claude.ai need to install dependecies:
Step 1: Install the missing TypeScript types
First, add the TypeScript types for pdfMake:
npm install --save-dev @types/pdfmake

remove take home box from "all status" because it doesn't do anything.

need to build selection choices for repairs

need to add ability to make work order without putting out of service.

take away free form box and make it selection for unit location


if github page not refreshing, delete the gh-page branch and redeploy with terminal npm run deploy

Clean your build cache:

# Remove the dist folder and rebuild
rm -rf dist
npm run build
